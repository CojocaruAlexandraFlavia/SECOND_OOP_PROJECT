# SECOND OOP PROJECT

Classes:
* "Pereche": pair of integers;
* Abstract class: "Multime pereche" which has a pointer to the class "Pereche";
* Derived classes: "Stiva pereche" and "Coada pereche" which implement the specific behavior of **"Stack"** and **"Queue"** (push and pop), but for pairs of integers.
